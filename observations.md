1. In what various ways does the servo behave differently than a DC motor? The servo has to be programed and not just turn up the voltage like the DC motor.
2. What makes the use of a servo more complex (remember that if you were controlling a DC motor with a Pi, you would need to write some code)? 
It move in tertment and back in forthe and the motor just keep going.
3. What applications do you thin servos are appropriate for? Explain. I think the servo is better for persisth things.
